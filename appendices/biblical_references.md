## Closing Reflection

As we pursue physical wellness, let it be a reflection of our spiritual commitment. May our eating, movement, and rest honor the One who created our bodies and sustains our souls. In every choice—from the food we grow to the meals we share, from our morning prayers to our evening reflections—let us remember that we are stewards of God's good gifts.

Our bodies are not just temples of the Holy Spirit; they are instruments of worship, vessels of service, and testimonies to God's grace. As we care for them with wisdom and discipline, may we grow not only in physical health but in spiritual maturity, bringing glory to God in all things.

*"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship."* - Romans 12:1
