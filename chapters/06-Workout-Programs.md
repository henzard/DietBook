## Prayer & Movement Integration

### Before Workout
"Lord, thank you for this body and the ability to move. Guide my efforts and let this time be worship."

### During Workout
- Breathe in: "Your strength"
- Breathe out: "My weakness"
- Each rep: "For Your glory"

### After Workout
"Thank you for the strength to complete this workout. May it honor You and serve Your purposes."

## Program Customization

### Individual Adjustments
- Based on goals
- Time constraints
- Equipment availability
- Recovery capacity

### Special Considerations

- Health conditions
- Age factors
- Lifestyle integration

## Conclusion

Remember that consistency in movement, like consistency in prayer, builds strength over time. Start where you are, honor your body's needs, and let each workout be an act of worship. Your journey to strength and health is a marathon, not a sprint - and every step, every rep, every prayer matters.
