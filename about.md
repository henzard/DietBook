# About the Author

Hi, I'm Henzard — a husband, dad, and engineer living in Bloemfontein, South Africa. I lead a software team by day, dig in the garden by sunset, and ask big questions about faith, health, and what it means to live simply but deeply.

I’ve spent most of my adult life trying to reconcile the modern world with ancient wisdom. For years, I wrestled with fatigue, food sensitivities, and stress — all while trying to be a good father and keep up with the noise of success. Like many, I leaned on coffee, convenience food, and control. Eventually, my body pushed back.

What changed everything was Scripture. When I read that _“your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit”_ (1 Corinthians 6:19), it hit hard: this wasn’t about vanity or willpower. It was stewardship. Worship.

That conviction led me to natural living — making broth, fermenting vegetables, learning to listen to my body and to God. I follow a GAPS-inspired, mostly plant-based rhythm that nourishes without obsessing. I train 5 times a week not to chase a six-pack, but to stay strong enough to serve. I journal my prayers and track my HRV. I breathe, pray, and reset when life gets loud.

I’m not perfect — I have young kids, disrupted sleep, and the occasional off day. But I’ve found joy in doing the simple things well, with integrity and intention.

This book is for anyone who’s tried the biohacks and burnouts, but longs for something rooted. It’s not a plan to fix yourself — it’s an invitation to walk with God through your body, your kitchen, your routines.

I believe:
- The Bible is 100% true.
- Health is a journey, not a performance.
- Digital tools can serve a holy life if used with discernment.
- Grace matters more than grind.

My hope is that this book helps you reclaim peace, energy, and alignment — not just with your health, but with your calling.
